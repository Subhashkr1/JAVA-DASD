Q-1. What is statically typed and Dynamically typed Programming Language ?
Ans. In statically typed programming languages, type checking occurs at compile time. At compile time, source code in a specific programming language is converted to a machine-readable
     format. This means that before source code is compiled, the type associated with each and every single variable must be known.
     Some common examples of programming languages that belong to this category are Java, Haskell, C, C++, C#, Scala, Kotlin, Fortran, Go, Pascal, and Swift.

     Conversely, in dynamically typed languages, type checking takes place at runtime or execution time. This means that variables are checked against types only when the program is
     executing. Some examples of programming languages that belong to this category are Python, JavaScript, Lisp, PHP, Ruby, Perl, Lua, and Tcl.

Q-2. What is the variable in Java ?
Ans. Variable in Java is a data container that saves the data values during Java program execution. Every variable is assigned a data type that designates the type and quantity of 
     value it can hold. A variable is a memory location name for the data.

Q-3. How to Assign a Value To Variable?
Ans.  dataType variableName = Value;
     example : int num1 = 10;
               float num2 = 10.34f;
               double num3 = 12.234;
               char spell = "A";
               string str = "new word"

Q-4. What are Primitive Data types in Java?
Ans. A primitive data type specifies the size and type of variable values, and it has no additional methods.

     There are eight primitive data types in Java:

     Data Type   Size	        Description
     ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
     byte	     1 byte	        Stores whole numbers from -128 to 127
     short	     2 bytes	  Stores whole numbers from -32,768 to 32,767
     int	     4 bytes	  Stores whole numbers from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
     long	     8 bytes	  Stores whole numbers from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
     float	     4 bytes	  Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 6 to 7 decimal digits
     double	     8 bytes	  Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 15 decimal digits
     boolean     1 bit	        Stores true or false values
     char	     2 bytes	  Stores a single character/letter or ASCII values
     ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Q-5. What are the Identifiers in Java?
Ans. Identifiers in Java are names that distinguish between different Java entities, such as classes, methods, variables, and packages. Identifiers include the names of classes,
     methods, variables, packages, constants, etc. These identifiers are each specified using a specific syntax and naming scheme.

Q-6. List the Operators in Java?
Ans. Arithmetic Operators
     Relational Operators
     Bitwise Operators
     Logical Operators
     Assignment Operators
     Misc Operators 

Q-7. Explain about Increment and Decrement operators and give an examples
Ans. Increment operators are used to increase the value of the variable by one and decrement operators are used to decrease the value of the variable by one in Java programs. 
     Syntax: Increment operator: ++var_name; (or) var_name++; Decrement operator: – -var_name; (or) var_name – -;
     Example: Increment operator : ++ i ; i ++ ;
