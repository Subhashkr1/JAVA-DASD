Q-1. What are the Conditional Operators in Java?
Ans.In Java, conditional operators check the condition and decides the desired result on the basis of both conditions. In this section, we will discuss the conditional operator in Java.
    There are three types of the conditional operator in Java:

    Conditional AND
    Conditional OR
    Ternary Operator


Q-2. What are the types of operators based on the number of operands ?
Ans. An operator is called a unary, binary, or ternary operator based on the number of operands. If an operator takes one operand, it called a unary operator; if it takes two operands,
     it called a binary operator; if it takes three operands, it called a ternary operator.

Q-3. What is the use of Switch case in Java programming?
Ans. The switch case in java executes one statement from multiple ones. Thus, it is like an if-else-if ladder statement. It works with a lot of data types. The switch statement is used
     to test the equality of a variable against several values specified in the test cases.

Q-4. What are the priority levels of arithmetic operation in java?
Ans. Operators	                                 Precedence
     ____________________________________________________________________________________________________
     postfix increment and decrement	         ++ --
     prefix increment and decrement, and unary	   ++ -- + - ~ !
     multiplicative	                           * / %
     additive	                                 + -
     shift	                                       << >> >>>
     relational	                                 < > <= >= instanceof
     equality	                                 == !=
     bitwise AND	                                 &
     bitwise exclusive OR	                      ^
     bitwise inclusive OR	                     |
     logical AND	                                 &&
     logical OR	                                 ||
     ternary	                                 ? :
     assignment	                                 = += -= *= /= %= &= ^= |= <<= >>= >>>=

Q-5. What are the conditional Statements and use of conditional statements in Java?
Ans. Conditional statements allow us to evaluate an expression and execute some code dependant upon the outcome.
     - if else statements

Q-6. What is the syntax of if else statement?
Ans. if (condition) {
              // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
      } else {
               // block of code to be executed if the condition is false
             }

Q-7. what are the 3 types of iterative statements in java?
Ans. - for loop
     - while loop
     - do while loop

Q-8. Write the difference between for loop and do-while loop?
Ans. for loop provides a concise way of writing the loop structure. Unlike a while loop, a for statement consumes the initialization, condition and increment/decrement in one line
      thereby providing a shorter, easy to debug structure of looping.

       Syntax:

            for (initialization condition; testing condition; increment/decrement){
                                              statement(s)
                             }

    do-while loop:
       do while loop is similar to while loop with the only difference that it checks for the condition after executing the statements, and therefore is an example of Exit Control Loop.

        Syntax:

             do{
                 statements..
                 } while (condition);

Q-9. Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 10.
Ans. public class Basic{
         public static void main(String[] args){
             for(int i=1; i=10; i++){
                 System.out.println(i);
                 }
          }
      }
